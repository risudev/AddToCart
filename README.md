# 🛒 React Add to Cart Modal App

This is a simple e-commerce-style ReactJS application that fetches products from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and allows users to add items to a cart using a modal interface. The project demonstrates the use of React components, props, state management, conditional rendering, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
